Feel free to use and modify to fit your needs.

This T4 template for ASP.NET MVC apps creates strongly typed helpers that eliminate the use
of literal strings when referring the controllers, actions and views.

To use it, simply copy it and T4MVC.settings.t4 to the root of your MVC application.

This will enable the following scenarios:

Refer to controller, action and view names as shown in these examples:
    - MVC.Dinners.Name: "Dinners" (controller name). 
    - MVC.Dinners.Views.DinnerForm: "DinnerForm" (view name)
    - MVC.Dinners.Actions.Delete: "Delete" (action name)

Strong type certain scenarios that refer to controller actions.  e.g.
    - Html.ActionLink("Delete Dinner", MVC.Dinners.Delete(Model.DinnerID))
    - Url.Action(MVC.Dinners.Delete(Model.DinnerID))
    - RedirectToAction(MVC.Dinners.Delete(dinner.DinnerID))
    - Route defaults e.g.
            routes.MapRoute(
                "UpcomingDinners", 
                "Dinners/Page/{page}", 
                MVC.Dinners.Index(null)
            );

Refer to your static images and script files with strong typing, e.g.
    Instead of <img src="/Content/nerd.jpg" ...>, you can write <img src="<%= Links.Content.nerd_jpg %>" ...>
    Instead of <script src="/Scripts/Map.js" ...>, you can write <script src="<%= Links.Scripts.Map_js %>" ...>
    Or if the file name is dynamic, you can write: Links.Content.Url("foo.jpg")

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Users running VisualSVN have reported some errors when T4MVC tries to change actions to virtual and controllers to partial.
  The suggestion when that happens is to manually make those changes.  This is just a one time thing you need to do.
- It will not locate controllers that live in a different project or assembly
- Compile error when folder under Content contains subfolder with same name as itself (http://blogs.msdn.com/davidebb/archive/2010/01/04/t4mvc-2-6-10-fluent-route-value-api-shorter-way-to-refer-to-action-and-more.aspx#9952727)

* What was previously called Actions was renamed to ActionNames (note, that's a BREAKING CHANGE if you used Actions before!)
